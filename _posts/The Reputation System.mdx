## Introduction

A reputation system is a tool used to measure the level of trust and contribution that a community member has. It incentivizes good behavior and acts as a tool to weed out bad actors. A reputation system can help to ensure that community members are recognized for their contributions, and are given opportunities based on their abilities and work.

## The Need

The FOSS community values collaboration and contribution. A reputation system is needed to recognize those who contribute meaningfully to the community and help to maintain a positive environment for all members.

## The System

The reputation system is based on Score. Members will earn Score for contributions they make to the community, and will lose Score for negative behavior. Score is visible to all members and is an indicator of a member's contributions to the community.

### Score Calculation

The following activities can earn a member Score:

*   Solving issues on the FOSSCU GitHub repository: 10-50 Score per issue solved.
*   Writing documentation for the FOSSCU projects: 10 Score per documentation page.
*   Hosting a workshop or giving a talk: 20 Score per event.
*   Contributing to FOSSCU's social media accounts: 5 Score per post.
*   Participating in FOSSCU events: 5 Score per event.

Members can also lose Score for negative behavior, such as:

*   Violating the community code of conduct: -50 Score.
*   Submitting low-quality work: -10 Score per instance.
*   Not showing up for a scheduled event: -5 Score per instance.

### Score Levels and Rewards

Score levels are used to recognize members who have contributed meaningfully to the community. The following levels and rewards are proposed:

*   Level 1: 0-50 Score
    *   Access to limited community resources.
    *   Eligible to participate in community events.
*   Level 2: 50-200 Score
    *   Access to more community resources.
    *   Eligible to participate in exclusive community events.
    *   Can be considered for future FOSSCU leadership positions.
*   Level 3: 200-500 Score
    *   Access to all community resources.
    *   Eligible to participate in all community events.
    *   Considered for FOSSCU leadership positions.
*   Level 4: 500+ Score
    *   Exclusive access to FOSSCU leadership opportunities.
    *   Recognized as a leader in the community.

### Implementation

The reputation system can be implemented using a tool like Discord bots or a custom-built system. Score can be tracked in a spreadsheet or database and updated manually by community leaders. Members can be notified of their Score levels and rewards through a publicly available dashboard.

To ensure fairness and transparency in the system, community leaders should regularly review Score calculations and ensure that members are being rewarded appropriately for their contributions. Additionally, members should be able to contest Score deductions if they feel they were wrongly penalized.
