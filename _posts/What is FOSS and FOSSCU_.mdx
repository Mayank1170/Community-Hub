## What is FOSS and FOSSCU

**FOSS** stands for **Free and Open Source Software**. It refers to software that is released under a license that allows users to *use, modify, and distribute* the software freely, without restrictions. FOSS is built on the idea that software should be open and accessible to everyone, without any barriers to entry.

**FOSSCU** is a community of students, developers, designers, and other creative individuals who are passionate about promoting the use and development of FOSS. FOSSCU stands for Free and Open Source Software Community of University, and it is focused on creating a platform for students to learn, grow, and contribute to the FOSS ecosystem.

FOSSCU aims to provide a space for students to develop their skills, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and contribute to FOSS projects. The community welcomes anyone who is interested in FOSS, regardless of their background or skill level. FOSSCU provides a range of resources, including learning materials, mentorship, and networking opportunities, to help members learn and grow within the FOSS ecosystem.
