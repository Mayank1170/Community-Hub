## Introduction

Proposing a new structure for the community is needed. The new structure focuses on members who constantly contribute to the community and keeping the space 'Open to All' at the same time. Thus, everyone regardless of their college year get equal opportunities and perks they deserve.
This structure also ensures that members **giving back** to the community get rewarded for their work.

## The Need

Unlike competitive programming, the Open Source world respects everyone from all backgrounds. Folks need not to be a developer only to contribute to the community. We welcome all creatives and developers.
You can be one(or more) of these to contribute back:

*   Developer
*   Designer
*   Writer
*   Developer Relations and Growth
*   Operations/Community Management

To ensure that everyone gets equal opportunities and keep the motivation going through the community, it is required to divide the community into a hierarchy.
Moreover, it lets the mentors focus on the *cream* and making it easier to work with.

## The Structure

The community will be divided into three tiers based on the contribution. Believing in "*With great power, comes great responsibilities*", we have defined responsibilities and perks for each tier. They are classified into:

*   Learners (Level 1)
*   Contributors (Level 2)
